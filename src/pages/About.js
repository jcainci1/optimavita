              Hello! I’m Joe Meehan, the founder of OptimaVita, a Nutrition,
              Wellness, and Longevity consulting company dedicated to helping

                  Although I’ve always been fascinated by the inner workings of
                  the human body, my passion for health and nutrition was truly
                  ignited in 2011 when my mom was diagnosed with cancer.
                  Watching her fight through that difficult time sparked a deep
                  curiosity about how nutrition can impact overall health. This
                  personal experience set me on a long journey of research,
                  trial and error, and optimization, all driven by the desire to
                  support and empower others in their own health journeys.

                  Throughout my college and professional basketball career, I
                  experienced numerous injuries, followed by significant health
                  challenges after my playing days ended. Each setback fueled my
                  determination to achieve optimal health. These personal
                  struggles led me to deepen my understanding of human
                  physiology and the critical role nutrition, exercise, and
                  lifestyle play in overall well-being.

              After earning my Bachelors in Biology Pre-Med, I spent 9 years
              coaching collegiate basketball, where I helped athletes push their
              limits and achieve peak performance. During this time, my passion
              for nutrition and wellness continued to grow, leading me to
              amplify my knowledge and begin sharing it with others to help them
              achieve their optimal health, both on and off the court.
