Combining my background in coaching and my\n              understanding of human physiology, I developed a holistic approach\n              to wellness that focuses on all aspects of health—from nutrition\n              and exercise to sleep optimization and stress management.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              At OptimaVita, I take a personalized, attentive approach to\n              coaching, helping individuals—whether overcoming health challenges\n              like obesity or striving to optimize their fitness—develop\n              sustainable strategies for lasting health and vitality. My\n              coaching is grounded in functional medicine, which focuses on\n              identifying and addressing the root causes of health concerns for\n              long-term well-being.\n
